# Scope Estimation: Converting Requests Table to Mobile Card Format

Please analyze the current Requests page and provide a detailed scope estimate for converting it from table format to a mobile-friendly card format. Address each of the following areas:

## Current Implementation Analysis
1. **Technology Stack**: What framework/library is used for the Requests page? (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, etc.)
2. **CSS Framework**: Are you using any CSS frameworks? (Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material-UI, custom CSS, etc.)
3. **Current Responsive Behavior**: How does the table currently behave on mobile devices?
4. **Table Structure**: 
   - How many columns does the table have?
   - What types of data are displayed in each column?
   - Are there any nested or complex data structures?

## Functionality Assessment
5. **Interactive Elements**: What interactive features exist in the table?
   - Sorting capabilities
   - Filtering/search functionality
   - Inline editing
   - Action buttons (edit, delete, view details, etc.)
   - Checkboxes for bulk actions
   - Pagination or infinite scroll

6. **Data Operations**: How is data loaded and managed?
   - API calls for data fetching
   - Real-time updates or websockets
   - Local state management
   - Caching mechanisms

## Design Requirements
7. **Card Layout Needs**: 
   - Which fields should be most prominent in the card view?
   - Are there fields that can be hidden or shown on expand?
   - Do you need different card layouts for different request types/statuses?

8. **Responsive Strategy**: 
   - Should this be mobile-only cards, or responsive cards for all screen sizes?
   - Do you want to maintain table view for desktop and cards for mobile?
   - What breakpoints should trigger the layout change?

## Technical Considerations
9. **Component Architecture**: 
   - Is the table a reusable component used elsewhere?
   - Are there existing card components in the codebase?
   - How is the table integrated with other page components?

10. **Performance Impact**: 
    - How many requests typically display per page?
    - Are there performance considerations with the current table?
    - Will card format affect loading or rendering performance?

## Integration & Dependencies
11. **External Dependencies**: 
    - Are there third-party table libraries being used?
    - Are there dependencies on specific table plugins or extensions?
    - What testing frameworks are in place?

12. **Backend Considerations**: 
    - Will API responses need modification for card format?
    - Are there any backend sorting/filtering dependencies?

## Delivery & Maintenance
13. **Rollout Strategy**: 
    - Should this be a feature flag rollout?
    - Are there different user roles that might need different views?
    - What's the timeline expectation?

14. **Testing Requirements**: 
    - What testing coverage currently exists for the Requests page?
    - Are there automated tests that would need updates?
    - What devices/browsers need testing?
