Deployment issue

# Description
Here's a summary of the deployment issues we've been facing with the Poopalotzi application:

Deployment Issue Summary for Poopalotzi Application
Errors Encountered
"Module format error: The application built with ESM (ECMAScript modules) doesn't recognize the ESM imports in dist/index.js"
"Node.js is not properly configured to use ES modules in the built output"
"The application is crashing due to import statement syntax errors"
"SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word in dist/index.js"
"'await' keyword used outside an async function in dist/index.js"
"Deployment crash loop detected, possibly due to syntax errors not caught during build phase"
Approaches Tried
Original Complex Application

React frontend with Tailwind CSS
Express.js backend
PostgreSQL database integration
Full features including authentication, service management, etc.
Simplified Express.js Server

Removed React dependencies
Used ES modules syntax
Simplified database to in-memory storage
Basic API endpoints for service data
CommonJS Compatibility Version

Changed to require/module.exports syntax
Explicitly set "type": "commonjs" in package.json
Removed async/await syntax in favor of callbacks
Reduced dependencies to just Express.js
Minimal HTTP Server

Used Node.js built-in http module only
No external dependencies
Simplified single-file server
Hardcoded service data
Static HTML Only Version

Created a pure HTML/CSS page
No JavaScript dependencies
No server code required
Fully static content
Each approach has resulted in similar deployment failures at the "promotion" phase, suggesting there might be specific configuration requirements or limitations in the Replit deployment system.

Additional Attempts
Added "engines" specification in package.json
Created replit.nix file to specify Node.js version
Modified build scripts and deployment process
Despite all these efforts, we have been unable to successfully deploy the application, even with the simplest possible implementation.

This summary should help the Replit support team understand the scope of what you've tried and the persistent issues you're facing.
