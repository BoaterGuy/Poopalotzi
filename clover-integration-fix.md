# Clover Integration Issue Resolution

## Current Problem
Your Clover integration is failing because:
1. **API Token Permissions**: Your current token lacks payment processing permissions
2. **Endpoint Access**: The token can't access the ecommerce payment API (401 Unauthorized)
3. **Simulation Fallback**: All payments are falling back to simulation mode

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Order Creation**: Working correctly - orders appear in Clover dashboard
- **Payment Processing**: Failing due to insufficient API permissions
- **Transaction Recording**: Working correctly - transactions saved to database but marked as simulated

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Create New API Token with Payment Permissions
1. Go to https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/developers/
2. Select your merchant account (7NV1RDCFDVTC1)
3. Navigate to Setup â†’ API Tokens
4. Create new token with these permissions:
   - **Payments** (required for processing payments)
   - **Orders** (already working)
   - **Customers** (for customer management)
   - **Read** (for accessing merchant data)

### Step 2: Update Token in System
1. Log into admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin/clover-settings
2. Use "Direct Token Setup" method
3. Enter the new token with payment permissions

### Step 3: Test Real Payment Processing
Once the token is updated, the system will:
- Create orders successfully (already working)
- Process real payments through Clover API
- Record actual transaction IDs and amounts
- Stop falling back to simulation mode

## Current System Behavior
- **Development Mode**: Uses simulation for failed API calls
- **Transaction Logging**: All payments are properly recorded in database
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Fallback System**: Ensures payments don't fail completely

## Next Steps for Production
1. Update API token with payment permissions
2. Test with Clover test card numbers
3. Switch to production environment when ready
4. Configure webhooks for payment status updates
