- ✅ Fixed order processing to include detailed line items with tax breakdown in Clover dashboard  
- ✅ Enhanced customer creation with complete contact information storage in Clover
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive transaction logging with complete order metadata
- ✅ Created development-ready payment simulation with full order completion workflow
- ✅ Orders display correctly in Clover: $75 service + $6 tax = $81 total with customer details
- ✅ System ready for production once API token updated with payment processing permissions

## Current Status
✅ **Order Creation Complete**: Orders successfully created in Clover with accurate amounts and customer data
✅ **Line Items Working**: Service items and tax breakdown properly displayed in Clover dashboard

## Clover Integration Status
- Configuration Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Token permissions insufficient
- Merchant ID: 7NV1RDCFDVTC1 (verified and authenticated)
- API Token: Current token lacks "Payments" permission scope
- Environment: Sandbox 
- Order Creation: ✅ Working - orders appear in Clover dashboard
- Payment Processing: ⚠️ Falling back to simulation - needs payment permissions
- **Required Fix Steps**:
  1) Go to https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/developers/
  2) Select merchant account 7NV1RDCFDVTC1
  3) Navigate to Setup → API Tokens
  4) Create new token with "Payments" + "Orders" + "Read" permissions
  5) Use Direct Token Setup in admin panel with new token
