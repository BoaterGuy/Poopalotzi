- ✅ Fixed order completion - latest orders now showing "Paid" status in Clover
- ✅ Orders should now appear in Net Sales dashboard instead of remaining in "Open" status

## Clover Integration Status
- Configuration Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Token permissions insufficient  
- Merchant ID: 7NV1RDCFDVTC1 (verified and authenticated)
- API Token: Current token lacks "Payments" permission scope
- Environment: Sandbox 
- Order Creation: ✅ Working - orders appear in Clover dashboard with correct amounts
- Tax Handling: ✅ Fixed - website now includes tax in all payment flows
- Customer Data: ✅ Working - names and contact info properly stored
- Payment Status: ⚠️ Orders show "Open" instead of "Paid" due to token permissions
- **Current Issue**: Orders don't appear in Net Sales because they remain "Open"
- **Solution**: Create API token with "Payments" permission to complete order processing
